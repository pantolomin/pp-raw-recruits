# pp-raw-recruits

Decide how your recruits are generated rather than depending on your difficulty level.
Currently in Phoenix Point, your recruits are generated as the following:
* legendary: nothing - costs only food
* heroic: with armor - costs a bit more resources
* others: with armor and weapons - costs even more resources

By default, this mod generates recruits like "legendary" and with no mutations.
You get no armor or weapons but it costs only food. This way, you can start having lots of recruits training and just build the equipment you need.

Recruits already present in havens won't be impacted. But new recruits will be generated using this mod.
No new game required.

#### You can use the **pp-raw-recruits.properties** file if you want to tweak the settings:
```
# Recruits can have mutations
CanHaveMutation = false

# Recruits come with a faction armor
HasArmor = false

# Recruits can have consummable items
HasConsumableItems = false

# Recruits can have inventory items
HasInventoryItems = false

# Recruits come with faction weapons
HasWeapons = false
```
